# Changelog

## 0.4.1 — 2026-06-03

- **Add Opus 4.8** — `claude-opus-4-8` (and the `claude-opus-4-8-instant` virtual variant) are now first in the model order, so the `opus` shortcut resolves to Opus 4.8. It's an adaptive-thinking model with the label-accurate effort map (`low→low`, `medium→medium`, `high→high`, `xhigh→xhigh`; `max` reachable via a shifted `thinkingLevelMap` in `~/.pi/agent/models.json`), matching Opus 4.7.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-04

- **Add optional `-instant` variants for adaptive-thinking models** — Opus 4.6/4.7 and Sonnet 4.6 use their real pi model IDs for visible reasoning, plus optional `-instant` virtual variants (no reasoning blocks; effort still applies to compute). The `-instant` variant emits `--thinking disabled` so the CC binary doesn't silently re-enable reasoning from `~/.claude/settings.json` (`alwaysThinkingEnabled` / `effortLevel`). Disable virtual variants with `provider.instantVariants: false`. Haiku 4.5 is unchanged (not adaptive-thinking; uses budget-based thinking gated by `reasoning`).
- **Configurable per-model effort mapping** — replaced the single global `REASONING_TO_EFFORT` table with per-model `thinkingLevelMap` entries. Built-in defaults prefer label accuracy (`low→low`, `medium→medium`, etc.); users who want Opus 4.7 `max` reachable despite pi lacking a `max` selector can define explicit `claude-bridge` models in `~/.pi/agent/models.json` with shifted maps (`minimal→low, low→medium, …, xhigh→max`). See README "Provider" section for details.
- **Configurable effort when reasoning is off** — `provider.effortWhenReasoningOff` lets thinking-visible adaptive models send an effort value even when pi's reasoning selector is `off`, avoiding Claude Code's default effort without switching to an `-instant` model.
- **Fix: zero out model cost in `buildModels`** — per-token pricing in the footer was wrong because models inherited pi-ai's non-zero cost fields, which pi then multiplied by the huge token counts from the SDK. Now explicitly zeroed so pi's footer shows no cost.
- **Use `tools: []` instead of `disallowedTools` blocklist** — switch from blocking specific tools to explicitly passing an empty tools list, preventing any new default tools from silently leaking into bridge sessions.
- **Disable CC-side autocompact (`DISABLE_AUTO_COMPACT=1`)** — pi already owns context management and propagates its own `/compact` to CC. Letting CC autocompact too double-flushed the prompt cache and raced pi's threshold; manual `/compact` in CC is unaffected.
- **Fix: pi `/compact` no longer triggers CC autocompact-thrashing (issue #8)** — pi's compaction shrinks its messages array, but `syncSharedSession`'s REUSE check (`slice(cursor)`) silently returned `[]`, so the bridge kept `--resume`ing the pre-compact CC session JSONL. Over long sessions CC's own autocompact then refilled within 3 turns and tripped its anti-thrashing guard. Now subscribes to pi's `session_compact` event and forces the next sync down the REBUILD path so CC sees the post-compact history. Also subscribes to `session_tree` (branch nav has the same shape).
- **Refactor: split `needsRebuild` into `needsRebuild` + `forceRotate`** — only the abort case needs UUID rotation (to dodge late writes from the dying CC subprocess). Compact/tree now rebuild in place, preserving the sessionId and not leaking orphan JSONL files into `~/.claude/projects/`.
- **Block user-installed MCP servers from leaking into bridge sessions** — pass `--strict-mcp-config` unconditionally and set `ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS=0` in the spawned CC env, suppressing both filesystem (`~/.claude.json`, `.mcp.json`) and claude.ai cloud MCP servers. Override with `provider.strictMcpConfig: false`.
- **Consolidate config** — SDK plumbing (`appendSystemPrompt`, `settingSources`, `strictMcpConfig`) moved from `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`claudeAgentSdkProvider` block) to a `provider` block in `~/.pi/agent/claude-bridge.json`. Old location no longer read. Drop deprecated, unsafe `maxHistoryMessages`.
- **Bump deps** — `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` → ^0.2.126; migrate to TypeBox 1.x (new import paths per pi-mono 0.69); pi devDeps → ^0.72.1. Extract `registerTool` schemas to const with explicit `<typeof params>` generic to avoid TS2589 deep-instantiation under TypeBox 1.x.
- **Internal: move sources into `src/`** — `index.ts` and the extracted modules now live under `src/`; screenshots under `assets/`. `pi.extensions` and published `files` updated accordingly.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-18

- **Fix: empty thinking blocks on Opus 4.7** — Opus 4.7 silently changed default `thinking.display` from `"summarized"` to `"omitted"`, so streams emitted `thinking_start` + `signature_delta` with zero `thinking_delta` events, leaving `ThinkingBlock.thinking == ""`. Now pass `--thinking-display=summarized` via `extraArgs` whenever `effort` is set (both provider and AskClaude paths). Bump `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` to ^0.2.111 (required for Opus 4.7 + `--thinking-display` CLI flag). See [anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python#830](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/pull/830).
- **Fix: `cachePct` debug metric misleading** — denominator was `input + cacheRead`, so once a conversation warmed up (tiny `input`, huge `cacheRead`) every turn rounded to 100% — even turns that rebuilt the cache from scratch. Now `cacheRead / (input + cacheRead + cacheWrite)`, so cache-rebuild turns show a low percentage.
- **Internal: extract pure modules from `index.ts`** — split `models`, `skills`, `session-verify`, `extract-tool-results`, and `query-state` into their own TS files with real unit tests (no more `.js`+`.d.ts` mirror drift). Add `typecheck` script, `typescript` + `tsx` devDeps; test scripts run via `--import tsx`.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-17

- **Add: claude-opus-4-7 model** — Added `claude-opus-4-7` as a selectable model. The `opus` shortcut now resolves to 4.7 by default; 4.6 remains available for explicit pinning. Bumped `@mariozechner/pi-ai` to ^0.67.6 to include official model definitions (removed fallback).
- **Refactor: QueryContext class replaces module-level state** — 12 mutable `let` variables + manual `SavedQueryState` push/pop replaced with a `QueryContext` class and context stack. Adding new per-query state is now 1 property instead of 6 edit sites. Fixes `deferredUserMessages` not being isolated across reentrant queries (subagent could consume parent's deferred steers). MCP handlers now close over captured context, abort handler captures context at the correct point after push.
- **Fix: MODELS baseUrl leak** — the MODELS array exported to pi's provider registration now projects only the fields pi needs (id/name/reasoning/input/cost/contextWindow/maxTokens), stripping pi-ai's `baseUrl`/`api`/`provider`/`headers` so they can't shadow the values `registerProvider` supplies.
- **Internal: `repairToolPairing` moved to cc-session-io 0.3.0**; convert logic extracted to `convert.js` with `convert.d.ts` types; various dead-code / type-safety cleanup.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-15

- **Fix: stale cursor after tool-using first turn (issue #4)** — after the first turn used tools, the session cursor pointed at the wrong message, causing Claude to re-process stale context. Now correctly advances past all tool_result blocks.
- **Fix: session resume on symlinked paths / CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR** — cc-session-io now resolves symlinks (realpathSync + NFC) and honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, matching how Claude Code resolves session paths. Fixes "No conversation found" on macOS symlinked dirs. Bump cc-session-io → 0.2.0.
- **Verify-after-write for session files** — warns with diagnostic context if the written session file doesn't round-trip correctly, instead of letting Claude silently resume a corrupt session.
- **Session rebuild preserves sessionId** — provider switches no longer churn UUIDs.
- **CC CLI debug capture** — `CLAUDE_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` now also writes Claude Code's own debug stream to `~/.pi/agent/cc-cli-logs/`, one file per query.
- **Fix: debug() logged Error objects as `{}`** — now formats with message and stack.
- **Repair orphan tool_use/tool_result pairs before import** — prevents potential API 400s when history starts mid-turn after a provider switch.

## 0.1.6 — 2026-04-10

- **Fix: steer messages during tool execution now reach Claude** — when a user sends a steer while a tool is executing, pi injects it into context alongside the tool result. The bridge previously only processed tool results in this path, silently dropping the steer. Now detected and replayed as a continuation query after the current query completes.
- **Fix: "No conversation found with session ID" in dirs with dots/underscores/spaces** — bump `cc-session-io` to 0.1.2; `projectPathToHash` now matches the CLI's sanitization (`/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g` → `-`) instead of only replacing slashes
- **Fix: steer/followUp during tool execution no longer hangs** — `extractAllToolResults` now walks past injected user messages instead of stopping at them
- **ID-based tool result matching** — tool results are matched to MCP handlers by `toolCallId` instead of FIFO position; eliminates silent wrong-result delivery if order diverges
- Add integration tests for tool execution scenarios (normal, followUp, steer, parallel+steer, abort) with auto-restart on failure
- Add `defaultIsolated` config option for AskClaude
- Remove skill path aliasing (`.pi/` → `.claude/` round-trip); pass through real paths instead
- Rewrite skills block to reference MCP-bridged read tool (`mcp__custom-tools__read`)
- **Fix: AskClaude action summary showed raw SDK tool names** — normalize `mcp__custom-tools__*` and SDK names at creation; hide redundant `BashOutput` and recursive `AskClaude`; collapse only consecutive same-tool calls
